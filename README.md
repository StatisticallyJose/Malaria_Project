This study examines the factors influencing malaria presence in children residing in Gambia, Africa. By comparing the performance and interpretability of three statistical models: Lasso, Ridge, and Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS), We aim to identify the most effective and insightful model for predicting malaria incidence. While the primary coding for this project was provided by my professor, the analysis, interpretation, and creation of visualizations are my contributions. Additionally, I was responsible for debugging and cleaning of data, and tuning parameters to ensure reliability and accuracy of my findings.
